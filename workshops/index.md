The Arista CI Workshops are intended for engineers looking to learn the fundamentals of automation tools and get hands-on experience deploying network-wide configurations with Arista Validated Designs (AVD). The workshops are split into two in-person sessions, allowing time to grasp the basic automation concepts before moving into building Data Models to deploy AVD. The content on this site is an overview of the topics we will cover in person with full details and examples.

!!! note
    The workshops are meant to be leveraged within an Arista Test Drive (ATD) lab. You may follow along using a personal environment; additional setup may apply.
