# Welcome to CI/CD Basics

In this section we'll cover the many facets of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This post will go over the what and why of CI/CD, and why someone like a network engineer should care about these concepts. The last portion of this section will go over a sample of tools that fit into a CI/CD workflow and walk users through a simple example.

Readers should be familiar with the following concepts.

- [Git](git.md)
- [VS Code](vscode.md)
- [YAML](jinja-yaml.md)

## What

In it's simplest form CI/CD allows development teams to accurately and efficiently deploy new versions of an application. The pipeline will take care of building and testing the new code base. Once all the tests have passed, the new application can either be manually deployed or deployed through the pipeline. This goes without saying that everything in the pipeline should be tracked with Git or some type of version control system.

## Why

That may sounds great but you may be wondering, why do I need a pipeline? As it turns out, delivering new versions of software is hard. Building a pipeline may seem like a big process, but over time, the time savings are incredible compared to the time taken to initially build the pipeline. CI/CD allows developers to have a consistent workflow, automated testing, and
