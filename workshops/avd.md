# Arista CI Workshop

This section we will leverage open source tools to build a network CI pipeline for configuration development, deployment, documentation and validation. Enabling us to manage our network environment as code!

This section will cover:

- Arista Validated Designs (AVD) Ansible Collection
- Network Data Models
- Initial Deployment (Day 0 Provisioning)
- Ongoing Operations (Day 2 and Beyond)
- Validation and Troubleshooting
- Enhancing our CI/CD Pipelines with GitHub Actions

Each attendee will receive their own dedicated virtual lab environment with Git, VSCode and Ansible already installed and ready to use.

Attendees will need:

- A laptop
- An account on www.github.com
- Familiarity with the concepts and tools covered in the previous [Automation Fundamentals workshop](https://aristanetworks.github.io/avd-workshops/) (Git, VSCode, Jinja/YAML, Ansible).
